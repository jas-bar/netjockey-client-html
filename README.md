# netjockey-client-html
netjockey is a clone of famous service plug.dj written from scratch. Except, you can host this one yourself!
netjockey utilizes strict separation of client side and server side.
Server is there only to provide RESTful API for clients to connect to. 
Clients play music from YouTube and handle user interface.

This netjockey client uses HTML + AngularJS + official YouTube APIs.

Are you looking for a server software? Here's a link to our official NodeJS server: https://github.com/jas-bar/netjockey-server-node
